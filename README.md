Processing code developed as a starting point for students on BA Digital Creativity at Liverpool Hope University. The code creates a small square or 'pixel' to mimic a grain of sand that appears at any point where the mouse is clicked on screen and falls to the bottom of the skethc. The second version iterates the sketch to begin to stack the grains of sand. How can you further develop this sketch?
